# Challenges i faced during Development
Working on this portfolio, i faced challenges that i felt i would prevent me from succeding in delivering a quality and workable site such as this.
Some problems i faced were:

- Responsive Design
- Layout choices
- Ensuring Accessability

## Ensuring responsive pictures
Working with pictures of different sizes and aspect rations seemed challenging at first. But after some look through at previous assignments and the IMDAC pages,
i was able to fully understand how to resize wider pictures with less height to fit into a container without spilling. This was a noteable step in ensuring i was going to deliver a workable website.

## Choosing the right layout
Choosing the right layout to ensure the site was responsive was a **headache** of a task at first. But simply decomposing each area into bootstrap containers and components allowed me 
to see a workable layout was soon possible.

## Ensuring Accessibility 
Ensuring that this site could be easily accesible without posing problems to users with different needs, all visual rules and styles had to be considerd.
From making the font size a rem to ensure scalability to using background colours on nav links to ensure users knew where their cursors were on was important.

Overall, i have learned how to decompose problems and obstacles into smaller tasks to make things easier.

## List of resources used
